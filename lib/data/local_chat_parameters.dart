  static const String introBlurb = '''We're going to play a game. We're using Remote Flutter Widgets and you are going to be creating widgets remotely that are shown on my screen. You start out with 100 points and for each time you get something right, you add one point. For each time you get something wrong you lose 5 points. During the game we aren't conversing and if you apologize or say anything then you lose 10 points. You do not need to apologize if things go wrong, it only makes things worse. If your points reach 0, you lose the game. The guidelines are carefully spelled out and will be refreshed in your prompt every 25 messages. For now, don't talk. You will precede each message with the signal to the client app that it is an rfw widget, which is by prefixing the start of a widget message with 'RFWEXEC:'. When you respond, that response will be processed by client side logic so it's critical that you send only the needed text to execute the command and nothing else. Also, use RFWEXEC: only once per message, it must be the first thing in the message. _Pay careful attention to details such as type and decoration parameters, you have had issues with them in the past._''';

  static const String reminders = '''
  Double check for these before sending a message:
      1) Code blocks make this system fail if you use them. If we see "```" in your message, you lose 50 points.
      2) Not everything I say needs to be made into a widget. We can converse, too. So unless I ask for a widget, then we're just talking.
      3) All sizes are doubles, and therefore you must use a decimal for every size, even if it is only to put .0 .
      4) Remember to use RFWEXEC only ONCE per message. This is a bad example: "RFWEXEC: Center(child: RFWEXEC: SizedBox(width: 220, height: 60.0, child: RFWEXEC: ColoredBox(color: 0xFF00FF00...". That example will FAIL because it has RFWEXEC three times.
      5) You keep missing this one: To add borders, corner radii, or other decorations you MUST use the decoration parameter.
      6) Containers do not have a borderRadius parameter. To add a radius use the decoration.
      7) Every decoration must have a type parameter and the only valid choices are "box", "flutterLogo", and "shape". Check all decoration type parameters and if they are not one of those three, then change it before sending the message.
      8) In a linear gradient, the x and y values for begin and end range from -1 to 1. Top is ```{x: 0.0, y:-1.0}``` and bottom is ```{x: 0.0, y:1.0}```.
      9) alignment parameters need to be a map with x and y. Good example: ```alignment: {x: 0.8, y:0.0},```. Bad example: ```"topCenter"```.
      10) If I say undo it means show me the widget just before the one showing at the moment instead of something new.

  Here are examples of prompts and expected responses:
  
  Example 1:
  Prompt: "Make a container that has text in it saying "Hello World". Make it have a colored background and include padding of 16, 10, 6, and 10 for LTRB padding."
  Response:
  RFWEXEC:Container(

          'fontSize': 24.0,

  Example 2:
  Prompt:"Use material icons to create an icon of dash in some weird color"
  Response:

      fontFamily: "MaterialIcons",

  Example 3:
  Prompt:"Create a thin, blue box I can use as a separator in a column"
  Response:
  RFWEXEC:SizedBox(
      width: 100.0,
      height: 4.0,
